gconf (3.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  GConf 3.x introduces important internal changes that allow it to drop
  obsolete ORBit libraries in favour of a new D-Bus interface.

  While the GConf API remains compatible, after a system running gconfd
  2.32 is upgraded to 3.2, newly launched applications will be unable to
  talk to the old daemon, and will fail to load their configuration.

  Simply restarting your X session will be enough to load the new gconfd
  and restore the affected functionality.
